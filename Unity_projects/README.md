# Deep_Blue-Jam
Deep Blue is an arcade game inspired by the titled "Frogger" from ATARI. It was created in 48h for a JAM.
We had to 1 - Make a blue-based game, 2 - Take non-copyright musics linked to the idea of blue, 3 - Make appear "Zorotl" from the clip "Blue" by Eiffel 65.
The player control a submarine, and must avoid looping waves of obstacles.
Half-way, the player must jump on the back of sea creatures and logs to reach the end.
The player has 3 lifes, the game has a max score, try to get the highest score !
